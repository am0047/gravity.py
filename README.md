# gravity.py
This is a Python Program to find the gravitational force acting between two objects.  

Problem Description
The program takes the masses of two objects and the distance between them to determine the gravitational force acting between the objects.

Problem Solution
1. Take in both the masses and the distance between the masses and store it in separate variables.
2. Initialize one of the variables to the value of gravitational constant, G.
3. The the formula is used to determine the force acting between the masses.
4. Rounding off up-to two decimal places, print the value of the force.
5. Exit.

Program Explanation
1. User must enter the values for both the masses and the distance between the masses and store it in separate variables.
2. One of the variables is initialised to the value of gravitational constant (G) which is equal to 6.673*(10**-11).
3. Then the formula: f=(G*m1*m2)/(r**2), where m1 and m2 are the masses and r is the distance between them, is used to determine the magnitude of force acting between the masses.
4. The force calculated is rounded up-to 2 decimal places and printed.
